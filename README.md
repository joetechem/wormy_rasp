# wormy_rasp
The pygame wormy, including descriptive headers for pygame walkthroughs.

wormy.py from the Raspberry Pi

Headers are added in the code for pointing out the different sections that help the game run smoothly.

In this repo, wormy.py has purposfully deleted code to offer a walkthrough of specific sections's functionality during class, whereas src.py is relatively untouched. Specific points to be discussed about each section of missing code.
