# wormy_rasp
pygame wormy, including descriptive headers for pygame walkthroughs  

wormy.py from the raspberry pi

Headers are added in the code for pointing out the different sections that help the game run smoothly.

In this repo, wormy.py has purposfully deleted code to offer a walkthrough of specific sections's functionality during class, whereas src.py is relatively untouched.
